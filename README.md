# DisInfoFinder
This app has a secondary purpose, and a primary purpose.
The primary purpose of this app is to at a minimum promote the idea of intelligent software capable of predicting "disinformation",
which is defined as:
  "false information which is intended to mislead, especially propaganda issued by a government organization to a rival power 
  or the media."
Disinformation is a tactic employed most recently and widely by the Soviet Union's KGB and succeeding intelligence agencies within 
the Russian Federation. It is often coined by western media and politicians as "fake news", and its primary purpose is to create 
chaos among the American and Western populaces, and major distrust in the government institutions that be.

However, the term "fake news" is often wrongly used by both left and right wing politicians, pundits and activists as a means of 
falsely discrediting actual news. Thus, this app's secondary purpose is to create the intelligent software capable of predicting 
such disinformation through unbiased methods. The purpose of being open source is identical in many respects to other open source
software: to be free for other like minded developers to "study, change and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose"
... and to tack on to that Wikipedia definition, to be free of the biases of corporations, political institutions, and other 
malicious groups who seek to destroy the truth. 

"Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." -John 8:32
